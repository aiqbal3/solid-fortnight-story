this is adeel's new story
welcome to the adventure
Adeel was on an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Adeel had no food and no water. One day Adeel saw a ship on the horizon and shot
a flare that he found in his now deflated raft. 
The ship did not notice him. 
He waited and waited for the next one. 
It was nightfall as his eyes began closing. 
He heard a ship horn and his eyes shot open with hope.
His last flare was now shot and the ship began coming towards him.
He was unconscious as the people of the ship saved him. 
He was grateful.
